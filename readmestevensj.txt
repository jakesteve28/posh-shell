Shell includes some of the pieces for it; however, it is very very very 
far
 from working to spec. 
The code has  few working parts, but
 overall it's terrible!


What I learned: 
I'm not nearly as good as a C programmer as I thought. 
I tried
 to implement the functions 
in the assignment, only thing I believe I got working

was the '&' and i'm basically resubmitting lab6 with
added code and the '&' deal. 

My computer was giving me 
issues with libraries, and my debugger would give me

weird errors with stdio or stdlib operations.
I'm running 18.04 ubuntu in a vm
